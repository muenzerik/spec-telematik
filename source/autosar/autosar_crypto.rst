AUTOSAR Requirements on Cryptography
=====================================

.. note:: Original document is available here: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/adaptive/22-11/AUTOSAR_RS_Cryptography.pdf

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall conceal symmetric keys from the users 
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02001
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00170

  **Description**
  There shall be no interfaces for the users to directly extract symmetric key
  values. Keys shall be addressed via identifiers by the users, preventing the key
  values disclosure

  **Rationale**
  If symmetric key values are available in the application at runtime it increases
  the risk of key compromise. If symmetric key values are stored in the
  application, centralized key management (e.g. renewal) is hard.

  **Use Case**
  Keys are stored in HSMs and never exposed in plain text.
  
  .. needuml::
    :key: sequence

    Alice -> Bob: Hi Bob
    Bob --> Alice: Hi Alice

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall conceal asymmetric private keys from the users 
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02002
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00170

  **Description**
  There shall be no interfaces for the users to directly extract asymmetric private
  key values. Keys shall be addressed via identifiers by the users, preventing the
  key values disclosure.

  **Rationale**
  If asymmetric private key values are available in the application at runtime it
  increases the risk of key compromise. If asymmetric private key values are
  stored in the application, centralized key management (e.g. renewal) is hard.

  **Use Case**
  Keys are stored in HSMs and never exposed in plain text.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support management of non-persistent session/ephemeral keys during their lifetime 
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02003
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  Some cryptographic keys are only used for a single message or communication
  session. These keys are referred to as “session keys” (usually for short-term
  symmetric keys) or “ephemeral keys” (for ephemeral public/private keys in
  asymmetric key-agreement protocols). The Crypto Stack shall support secure
  handling of session/ephemeral keys during their lifetime.

  **Rationale**
  The session/ephemeral keys are required for secure implementation of multiple
  cryptographic protocols. Session/ephemeral keys should not occupy persistent
  slots due to their transient nature.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support secure storage of cryptographic artifacts 
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02004
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00170

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support secure storage of cryptographic artifacts,
  including but not limited to the following items:

  - Secret, Private and Public Keys
  - Algorithm-specific Domain Parameters
  - Symmetric or asymmetric Signatures
  - Password Hashes
  - Secret Seeds
  - Certificate Signing Requests
  - Certificates and Certificate Chains
  - Certificate Revocation Lists
  
  Correspondent protection measures should be applied to each artifact
  according to its type: confidentiality, integrity, authenticity.

  **Rationale**
  Basic functionality

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support unique identification of cryptographic objects
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02005
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall assign and keep a unique identifier to any produced 
  cryptographic artifact that can be saved or exported.

  **Rationale**
  At least the unique identification of cryptographic objects is required for
  definition of dependencies between different objects. Also the unique identifiers
  can be used for general searching of concrete instances and prevention of
  duplication.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support a version control mechanism and distinguish “versions” and “origin sources” of cryptographic objects
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02006
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00514
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02005

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall apply a version control mechanism during saving of any
  cryptographic object. Also it shall provide interfaces for observing version
  information of any saveable or exportable cryptographic object. At least this
  information shall include “version number” and “origin source”.
  The information about an object’s version should stay actual after provisioning
  of the object to different ECUs, where it may be kept together with objects
  obtained from other sources. But a host/ECU that produced an object can
  ensure uniqueness and sequential order of the “version number” only in its own
  scope. Therefore additional attribute “origin source” is required and scope of its
  uniqueness should be global.
  Note: A few logically related objects of different types and generated together
  (like private and public keys of a single key-pair) must have common version
  number in order to simplify their versions identification.
  Note: Combination of the global uniqueness of the “origin source” and the local
  uniqueness of the “version number” (in scope of the source) together means
  that the version information uniquely identifies the object of specific type. It
  means that the version information together with the object type uniquely
  identify each cryptographic object saved in an ECU Key Storage

  **Rationale**
  The Crypto Stack should prevent the “repetition attacks”, when an attacker tries
  to import/inject again some outdated/compromised and already
  revoked/substituted object.

  **Use Case**
  A key slot owner application may use the version information of an owned
  object in it’s business logic.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide means for secure handling of “secret seeds"
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02007
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto stack shall provide interfaces for saving, loading, importing and
  exporting of secret seeds.

  **Rationale**
  The “secret seed” can represent some key material that cannot be directly
  loaded to a key input of some transformation, but it is used for derivation of
  concrete “slave” keys. Also the secret seed can be used for loading to a
  “non-key” input (like salt / nonce / initialization vector) of some cryptographic
  transformation, but specific application can need to keep it in secret too. For
  such secret objects the Crypto Stack shall support protection measures similar
  to the keys.
  Disclosure of the secret seeds can lead to compromising of whole crypto
  protocol.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support restrictions of the allowed usage scope for keys and “secret seeds
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02008
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00170, RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall keep the usage restriction information together with
  correspondent key or secret seed object and use this information every time,
  when an application tries to load the object to specific transformation context.
  The allowed usage scope should specify a list of cryptographic transformation
  types that can be executed using this key or seed object.

  **Rationale**
  The restriction of allowed usage of keys/seeds on the platform level prevents
  their inappropriate usage by untrusted or compromised applications. In such
  way, simple “cryptography restriction services” (like “encrypt only”, “decrypt
  only”, “verify only”, etc.) can be provided without implementation of dedicated
  services, but just via granting restricted usage access to correspondent keys.


.. req:: The Crypto stack shall support separation of applications” access rights for each cryptographic object slot
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02009
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00170
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02008

  **Description**
  Adaptive applications should have exclusive access to cryptogaphic object
  slots. Applications can execute saving and erasing of key slot content.
  The slot type ”application” allows only the configured application to use the slot
  contents.
  If the slot type is ”machine”, the configured application acts only as
  ”key-manager”, while stack services will be allowed to use the slot content (e.g.
  for SecOC, TLS).

  **Rationale**
  If two or more applications have the right to update some key slot, then each of
  them cannot trust to the key slot content, because potentially the content can
  be updated by a compromised application.

  **Use Case**
  Some Key Management application can be in charge of updating “machine”
  type platform keys.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to generate cryptographic keys for all supported primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02101
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support creating cryptographic keys without getting
  access to the plain key material.

  **Rationale**
  Key confidentiality

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall prevent keys from being used in incompatible or insecure ways
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02102
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00170

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack should detect and prevent use of keys with incompatible
  algorithms. Keys managed by the Crypto Stack shall be associated with
  information to detect and prevent use with conflicting or privileged operations

  **Use Case**
  Protect against unauthorized or incompatible operations that jeapardize
  confidentiality and integrity of key material (information leakage, key conjuring,
  API logic attacks).

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support primitives to derive cryptographic key material from a base key material
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02103
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support deriving cryptographic keys using a well-defined 
  algorithm from a base key without getting access to the plain key material.

  **Rationale**
  Generating multiple well-defined symmetric keys from a base key

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support a primitive to exchange cryptographic keys with another entity
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02104
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support exchanging cryptographic keys without getting
  access to the plain key material.

  **Rationale**
  Establish common secret

  **Use Case**
  Establish TLS session keys    

.. req:: Symmetric keys and asymmetric private keys shall be imported and exported in a secure format.
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02105
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00150

  **Description**
  The crypto stack shall provide interfaces for import and export of symmetric keys and asymmetric private keys in a secure format.

  **Rationale**
  Support secure distribution of keys from a backend system and/or migration or backup of keys between systems.

  **Use Case**
  Wrapping / unwrapping keys without exposing the key values.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces for secure processing of passwords
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02106
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00170

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support password based key derivation and secure
  password hashing. Passwords should be processed in a manner preventing
  their disclosure.

  **Rationale**
  Passwords are the simplest and widely used method for human users
  authentication.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support the algorithm specification in any key generation or derivation request
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02107
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02102

  **Description**
  Interfaces of the Crypto Stack shall support a possibility to provide a full or
  basic specification of the target cryptographic algorithm for any key generation
  (symmetric and asymmetric primitives) or key derivation (symmetric primitives
  only) requests.

  **Rationale**
  Inappropriate usage of a key (including a session key) can lead to leakage of
  confidential information or other type of compromising.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces for management and usage of algorithm-specific domain parameters
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02108
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  Interfaces of the Crypto Stack shall support a possibility to share some
  common domain parameters for configuration of different primitive’s instances.
  A single set of domain parameters can be used with different key values. In
  most cases domain parameters are public configuration attribute of an
  algorithm, but Crypto Stack API should support the confidential storage of
  domain parameters too.

  **Rationale**
  Most of modern asymmetric cryptographic algorithms use domain parameters,
  also some symmetric algorithms expects specific configuration parameters.
  The set of additional parameters required by some algorithm depends from the
  algorithm only and cannot be predicted in the general primitive’s interface.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support interfaces for a unified Machine-wide storage and retrieval of different crypto objects
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02109
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  A wide range of hardware (e.g. HSM/TPM/SHE based) and/or software based
  (e.g. encrypted files) can be supported for secure storage and retrieval of
  different crypto objects (e.g. keys, certificates, digests, etc.). Therefore, a
  unified Machine-wide access to all these different storage providers abstracts
  physical details about storage handling and reduces complexity of cooperative
  usage of different crypto objects by applications.

  **Rationale**
  A few trusted applications can have a need to use some keys (or other crypto
  objects) cooperatively while applications’ access rights to the crypto object
  slots needs to be controlled. A logically centralized crypto object storage
  handling can facilitate these scenarios conveniently..

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support prototyping of application-exclusive key slot resources
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02110
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support allocation of key slots during deployment of an
  application owning correspondent key slots. Access rights and content
  restrictions of the new key slots should be defined according to the application
  manifest at the allocation time.

  **Rationale**
  Key slot content restrictions and access rights required by the slots owning
  application depend on the application design and therefore they should be
  supplied as a part of application deployment package.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide applications a possibility to define usage restrictions of any new generated or derived key
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02111
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02008

  **Description**
  Interfaces of the Crypto Stack shall support the possibility to define the allowed
  usage restrictions of any new generated or derived key.

  **Rationale**
  The usage restrictions of a session key can be defined only by the application
  itself. Also the key slot prototype can miss or have only partial specification of
  the content restriction, in such way providing some flexibility to the application.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall execute export/import of a key value together with its meta information
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02112
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall execute export/import of a key object together with its
  whole meta information, which should include:

  - Unique identifier (at least “origin” and “version”)
  - Assigned cryptographic algorithm specification
  - Allowed usage restrictions

  These information must be part of integrity control of the exported/imported key
  object and optionally can be encrypted.

  **Rationale**
  The whole key’s meta information is required for its correct application.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack interfaces shall support control of the exportability property of a key object
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02113
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00170

  **Description**
  Owner application executing generation or importing of a cryptographic object
  shall have possibility to restrict the exportability property of the
  generated/imported object.

  **Rationale**
  Unauthorized export of a key (even in encrypted form) can compromise the
  system.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall enforce assigning required domain parameters to a key in its generation or derivation procedure
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02115
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  If some cryptographic algorithm requires specification of domain parameters
  then key generation or key derivation procedures producing key for this
  algorithm shall enforce direct specification of the domain parameters for the
  target key. Changing of the domain parameters assigned to an existing key
  should be impossible.
  The Crypto Stack implementation may provide some well-known domain
  parameters specified in some standards via their standardized names.

  **Rationale**
  For some asymmetric algorithms specification of a key is possible only in
  context of concrete domain parameters. Usage of a single (symmetric or
  asymmetric) key together with different domain parameters of its algorithm can
  lead to security risks.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support version control of key objects kept in the Key Storage
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02116
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00150, RS_Main_00514
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02109, RS_CRYPTO_02110

  **Description**
  A key slot shall allow to define a source of keys and switch on the version
  control mechanism for this key slot content. The Crypto Stack shall allow
  saving of a new key object into a key slot with enabled version control, only if
  the key version will be increased and the source is matching. The version
  control mechanism must keep the version of the last key saved in the slot even
  after erasing of the key value.

  **Rationale**
  The basic version control logic must be implemented by the Crypto Stack to
  enable rollback protection in a transparent way for applications.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use symmetric encryption and decryption primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02201
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support encrypting and decrypting data using an
  algorithm for symmetric encryption/decryption primitives.

  **Rationale**
  Encrypted data


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use asymmetric encryption and decryption primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02202
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support encrypting and decrypting data using an
  asymmetric algorithm.

  **Rationale**
  While encryption/decryption of bulk data (long messages) should be done
  using symmetric-key algorithms for efficiency reasons, the Crypto Stack
  supports also asymmetric encryption/decryption primitives required by special
  use cases that apply asymmetric encryption/deception on messages of short
  length and to facilitate implementing standards that include hybrid
  encryption/decryption schemes.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use asymmetric encryption and decryption primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02203
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support creating and verifying message authentication
  codes (MAC).

  **Rationale**
  SecOC using MACs to authenticate messages

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use digital signature primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02204
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support creating and verifying digital signatures

  **Rationale**
  Digitally signed updates

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use hashing primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02205
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support creating and verifying cryptographic hashes.

  **Rationale**
  Signature verification


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to configure and use random number generation
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02206
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support generating cryptographically strong random numbers.

  **Rationale**
  Random numbers are required to generate cryptographic keys, nonces and other inputs to cryptographic protocols.

  **Use Case**
  Once configured, random number generator is used by different primitives.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use authenticated symmetric encryption and decryption primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02207
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support encrypting and decrypting data using an algorithm for authenticated symmetric encryption/decryption primitives.

  **Rationale**
  Authenticated encrypted data


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use symmetric key wrapping primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02208
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02001, RS_CRYPTO_02002

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support symmetric authenticated encrypting/decrypting
  or wrapping/unwrapping of key values unavailable for applications in a plain
  form.

  **Rationale**
  Secure keys transportation.

  **Use Case**
  Export/Import of key material.

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall provide interfaces to use asymmetric key encapsulation primitives
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02209
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410
  :depends: RS_CRYPTO_02001, RS_CRYPTO_02002, RS_CRYPTO_02208

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism for
  secure transportation of key values

  **Rationale**
  Secure keys transportation.

  **Use Case**
  Export/Import of key material.

.. req::  The Crypto Stack API shall provide a standardized header files structure
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02301
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The application shall use standardized header files to abstract from the
  underlying implementation and platform.

  **Rationale**
  The applications code shall be reusable across different implementations of the
  AUTOSAR Adaptive platform.


.. req::  The Crypto Stack API shall support a streaming approach
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02302
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  Some primitives are generally used to process large amounts of data. This data
  may be streamed into the Crypto Stack in multiple smaller pieces.

  **Rationale**
  Basic functionality

.. req::  The Crypto Stack API shall support a streaming approach
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02304
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack interfaces providing cryptographic transformations should be
  logically separated from interfaces providing access control to key slots of the
  permanent Key Storage.

  **Rationale**
  The key access functionality supposes interaction with the IAM framework, but
  the cryptography implementation independent from this. Therefore separation
  of these two functional sub-domains simplifies implementation, support and
  extending of the whole Crypto Stack.
  Each of these sub-domains can be upgraded independently from another one.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support integration with a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02306
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support integration with a Public Key Infrastructure
  (PKI). For this reason it shall provide interfaces for at least: certificate parsing
  and verification, validation of certificate chains, creation of Certificate Signing
  Requests (CSR), storing and updating Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) and
  Delta CRLs for following usage by the stack, certificate validation via the Online
  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), ordering and transmission of certificates in
  certificate chains (full or partial), updating a defined set of root certificates.

  **Rationale**
  PKI is a widely used modern mean to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of
  information between untrusted parties for a range of network activities.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack design shall separate cryptographic API from the PKI API
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02307
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack interfaces providing cryptographic transformations should be
  logically separated from interfaces providing PKI related functionality.

  **Rationale**
  Main responsibility of the PKI functional domain is parsing and production of
  data structures in specific formats. Functionally, the PKI is a “consumer” of a
  cryptography implementation, and main functionality of the client-side PKI uses
  key-less or public key cryptographic transformations, i.e. it doesn’t need
  utilization of isolated private/secret contexts.
  Each of these sub-domains can be upgraded independently from another one.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support a unified cryptographic primitives naming convention, common for all suppliers
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02308
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00060, RS_Main_00150, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack should provide interfaces for mapping of unified (Crypto
  Stack supplier independent) cryptographic primitives’ names to some supplier
  specific ones.

  **Rationale**
  Introduction of the unified naming convention allows to enable development of
  portable application source code.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack API shall support the run-time configurable usage style 
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02309
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  A consumer application should have a possibility to select concrete
  cryptographic primitives and find out all their properties at run-time.

  **Rationale**
  In some use cases an application may not know in advance which concrete
  primitive it will use for data processing. For example this information can stay
  available after some “handshake” protocol execution only.
  Also the possibility to observe properties of currently used object or context is
  very useful for the application debugging.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack should support a joint usage of multiple back-end cryptography providers including ones with non-extractable keys
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02401
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack interfaces should support simultaneous cooperative usage of
  multiple software or hardware based cryptography implementations, which can
  implement the concept of non-extractable keys (HSMs/TPMs).

  **Rationale**
  Single ECU can have a few different HSMs/TPMs and additional software
  implementation of cryptography for usage in different application domains.


.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support isolating keys and requests
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02403
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00445, RS_Main_00514

  **Description**
  In a multi-tenant scenario the Crypto Stack shall implement an individual logical
  view of available session keys and active operations for each tenant.

  **Rationale**
  A application using the Crypto Stack should not be able to observe or
  manipulate the list of active keys and crypto operations of another application
  (error injection, timing side-channels, etc.).

.. req:: The Crypto Stack shall support the key slots identification in a way independent from a concrete deployment
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02405
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00060, RS_Main_00150, RS_Main_00410

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack shall support some type of unique logical key slot identifiers
  definable by application designers/developers.

  **Rationale**
  Application needs some simple identification mechanism of logical key slots
  that is independent from the deployment results, so that these slots identifiers
  can be directly defined in the executable code.


**Non-Functional Requirements**

.. req:: The Crypto Stack API shall support an efficient mechanism of error states notification
  :id: RS_CRYPTO_02310
  :tags: autosar, autosar_crypto
  :satisfies: RS_Main_00060

  **Description**
  The Crypto Stack should deliver comprehensive information about an error
  state what was detected. This information should be enough to recognize the
  error conditions and make decision how to recover from the error state and
  continue execution. The delivering mechanism should be convenient for
  applications’ developers and satisfy the Autosar AP C++14 Coding Guidelines.
  Note: The error states are not expected to be seen in normal program
  execution.

  **Rationale**
  Basic functionality
